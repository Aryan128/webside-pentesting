                    2.3 (Types of Cyber attack and its working)
 2.3.1(Password Attack)
Introduction- In password attack we use bruteforce attack. A Brute Force Attack is one of the most famous and widely known types of cyber attack out there. A brute force attack is a type of attack that uses a trial-and-error method to guess login credentials, and encryption keys, or find a hidden webpage. If someone repeatedly and unsuccessfully tries to log in to an account or network, it appears to be a brute force attack. In a brute force attack, the attacker uses a wordlist from which the passwords are guessed by the auxiliaries. scripts keep running until they hit and try each credential provided in the list.
In my tool you don’t need to install the brute-force software from the internet. We just have to make a list of possible passwords or you can make it from the information gathering option where we are provided with a password generator. The tool will automatically apply the hit and trial method to the login page of the metasploitable2. If the username and password satisfies the request then we will get the credentials of the login page. If the URL was incorrect it will detect it and give the error.











In this I am using metasploitable2 which we use for testing purposes. It is open source and easy to use, basically we use it for testing the vulnerabilities and for testing purposes in ethical hacking. In which we will apply different operations to ce=rack the website and to find the loopholes in that website. Then report that vulnerability to that organisation and in return they may give us a reward in terms of money, swags and a rewarded hall of fame to that person who finds the vulnerability.
What do hackers gain from Brute Force Attacks?
Profiting from ads or collecting activity data
Stealing personal data and valuables
Spreading malware to cause disruptions
Hijacking your system for malicious activity
Ruining a website’s reputation

Password attack in Python-
To make the tool we need to install a request module and then import it. Next, we’ll need the URL you’ll be working with; in my case, it’s the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA). Since we also need a username, you can simply ask the user to input it. In order to bruteforce anything, we typically use a dictionary of some sort with plenty of potential passwords within it. So, we need a dictionary file when bruteforcing websites as well. You can either use the rockyou.txt file (a file containing millions of hacked passwords) or create your own. For this example, I have created a sample dictionary with a few passwords (to show you how this works). If you’re using PyCharm, please save the password file in the appropriate working directory. Whenever we use the wrong username:password combination, there’s an error displayed on the site; the site says “Login failed”. Be careful about capital letters here! So what we’re going to do is to turn the response element into a string, and search for “Login failed” within it. If it contains the string “Login failed”, then we’ll pass, but if it doesn’t contain it, then we can say that we have successfully found the password!
Steps to execute Password attack
Select the Password attack option from the menu.
It will ask for the URL of the website, copy the URL and paste it on the terminal.
Then it will ask for the username, enter according to your guess.

Enter all the formality, then the tool will start functioning one by one.







2.3.2 (Botnet)
Introduction- Botnet is the network of computers or computers which are connected to the internet. These devices are centrally controlled or controlled by botnet honour personal computers. It passively collects information about devices or the websites. It may affect Servers, Mobile Phones, Routers and others. These devices are in a compromised state. Now they are used for DDos attacks.
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic. DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilising multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as Iot devices. From a high level, a DDoS attack is like an unexpected traffic jam clogging up the highway, preventing regular traffic from arriving at its destination.

Features of Botnet-
A network of infected auto controlled machines.
They can be coordinated remotely.
They are used for malicious purposes.
Advantages of Botnet in Python Python-
Nothing Written To The Disk − clients never write anything to the disk - not even temporary files because remote imports allow arbitrary code to be dynamically loaded into memory and directly imported into the currently running process.
Platform Independent − everything is written in Python and the clients generated can optionally be compiled into a portable executable (Windows) or bundled into a standalone application.
Bypass Firewalls − clients connect to the command & control server via reverse TCP connections, which will bypass most firewalls because the default filter configurations primarily block incoming connections.
Countermeasure Against Antivirus − avoids being analysed by antivirus by blocking processes with names of known antivirus products from spawning.
Encrypt Payloads To Prevent Analysis − the main client payload is encrypted with a random 256- bit key which exists solely in the payload stager which is generated along with it.
Prevent Reverse-Engineering − by default, clients will abort execution if a virtual machine or sandbox is detected.
Steps to use Botnet in Website Pentester-
Run the tool and then select the Botnet Option.
We will see the result of AIMETC website. 




















2.3.3 (Web Reconnaissance)
Introduction- Reconnaissance is the initial phase of any application pentest  Requires the most time of an attack process  Involves manual and automated techniques  More information is equal to attacks with more success  Any information is useful  It's necessary to understand the application  Before executing an attack is necessary to develop a methodical plan. Key stages: Stage I: Web Application Discovery Stage II: Information Gathering Stage III: Attack Vectors Analysis.For a pentest is necessary to test all web applications accessibles through the target  A web server can hide different applications.  Different base URL, Non-standard ports, Virtual hosts. Hidden applications based on different base URL  Suppose that http[s]:// www.example.com return: "No web server configured at this address" (or a similar message).  But there may be accessible applications: http[s]://www.example.com/app1 http[s]://www.example.com/somepath/app2 http[s]://www.example.com/some-strange-URL. Hidden applications based on different base URL  How to discover these applications? Taking advantage of directory browsing References from other(s) web page(s)‏ Analysing the application code Probing for URLs candidates.  For example: – /admin/ – /downloads/ – /partners/  Resources enumeration/discovery tools: – DirBuster. Main purpose: To create a base of knowledge useful in later stages ‏(?attacks(  The information should be as accurate as possible  The information obtained will drive the attacks. 
















Features of Web Reconnaissance-
Information Gathering 
Attack vector Analysis
Reconnaissance in Python
Requests library is used for making HTTP requests to a specific URL and returns the response. Python requests provide inbuilt functionalities for managing both the request and response. Python requests module has several built-in methods to make HTTP requests to specific URL using GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or HEAD requests. A HTTP request is meant to either retrieve data from a specified URI or to push data to a server. It works as a request-response protocol between a client and a server. Here we will be using the GET request.  GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. The GET method sends the encoded user information appended to the page request. 
Steps of using Web reconnaissance-
Select the web reconnaissance option from the menu.
Here we are reviewing the AIMETC website.

It will show the unique id of the website, language used in it and the domain name of the website.
If we want to see the request of the website that we see during inspect on that website.




2.3.4 (Encryption Tool)
Introduction- Encryption is the process of converting or scrambling data and information into an unreadable, encoded version that can only be read with authorised access. Encryption is a widely used security tool that can prevent the interception of sensitive data, either while stored in files or while in transit across networks. Every time we make a purchase online, use the bank ATM, text or call somebody, encryption keeps the transaction or communication private and highly secure. Encryption provides a layer of security so information is only accessed by the authorised users. It has become an essential part of our modern day lives. We should care about encryption as it provides privacy, security, integrity of data, and authentication. In many cases it is required for regulatory compliance.



















Features of Encryption-
Useful for hiding data from unauthorised access.
They can create encrypted volumes on storage media or encode information within digital files.
Encryption in Python-
Encryption is the act of encoding a message so that only the intended users can see it. We encrypt data because we don’t want anyone to see or access it.
We will use the cryptography library to encrypt a file. The cryptography library uses a symmetric algorithm to encrypt the file. In the symmetric algorithm, we use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the file. The fernet module of the cryptography package has inbuilt functions for the generation of the key, encryption of plain text into cipher text, and decryption of cipher text into plain text using the encrypt() and decrypt() methods respectively. The fernet module guarantees that data encrypted using it cannot be further manipulated or read without the key. 
Steps to use encryption tool-
Firstly we should have a file. Let us suppose we have a nbs.csv file. Where we have to apply the encryption.




















A .csv file is a  comma-separated values file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format. A CSV file typically stores tabular data in plain text, 


Then run the tool and select the encryption tool option.


























Then enter the file name like nba.csv.






















Then the key will be stored in a file called filekey.key.

The file will be presented in the documents with the key.

3.3 Development tools
In this tool I am using Python. Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently. Here  I had used different modules named as follows-


Pyfiglet
Os
Socket
Sys
Requests
Urllib
String
Itertools
Base64
Scapy.all
Smtplib
Json
Termcolor
Subprocess
Hashlib
cryptography.fernet
Pyfiglet- pyfiglet takes ASCII text and renders it in ASCII art fonts. figlet_format method converts ASCII text into ASCII art fonts.
OS- This package abstracts the functionalities of the platform and provides the python functions to navigate, create, delete and modify files and folders.
Socket- A network socket is an endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs or processes - client and server in our case - which are running on the network.


Sys- The sys module in Python provides various functions and variables that are used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment. It allows operating on the interpreter as it provides access to the variables and functions that interact strongly with the interpreter
Requests- Requests library is one of the integral part of Python for making HTTP requests to a specified URL.
Urlllib- Urllib package is the URL handling module for python. It is used to fetch URLs (Uniform Resource Locators).
String- String module contains some constants, utility function, and classes for string manipulation. Python String Module It’s a built-in module and we have to import it before using any of its constants and classes.
Itertool- Python’s Itertool is a module that provides various functions that work on iterators to produce complex iterators.
Base64- In computer programming, Base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in sequences of 24 bits that can be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits.
Scapy.all- Scapy is a packet manipulation tool for computer networks, originally written in Python by Philippe Biondi.
Smtplib- Python provides smtplib module, which defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mail to any Internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon.
Json- JSON is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and arrays.
Termcolor- It is used to print colour text in python.
cryptography.fernet- The fernet module of the cryptography package has inbuilt functions for the generation of the key, encryption of plaintext into ciphertext, and decryption of ciphertext into plaintext using the encrypt and decrypt methods respectively.
				






4. Case Study and Execution
The severity level indicates the impact a vulnerability has on the system if exploited. Vulnerabilities are hereby listed with corresponding remediation where necessary. A. Input returned in response (reflected) There were two instances of this issue. It affected the Home and Contacts page of the website. This issue could lead to client-side vulnerabilities such as cross site scripting, open redirection, content spoofing and response header injection. In a case such as this, server-side vulnerabilities like SQL injection is easier. This vulnerability could be further classified as Improper Input Validation which leads to unintended inputs and Improper Encoding or Escaping of output which leads to the structure of the message not being preserved. Remediation: Input should not be echoed at the application's response. B. Cross-domain Referer leakage There were three instances of this issue which occurred at the Contacts, Home and root page. The vulnerability was classified as Information Exposure vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) list. Remediation: Applications should never transmit any sensitive information within the URL query string. In addition to being leaked in the Referrer header, such information may be logged in various locations and may be visible on-screen to untrusted parties. C. Cross-domain script include This occurs when an application includes scripts from an external domain. The script is executed by the browser within the security context of the invoking application and can function as the applications own script and has access rights to the application data and perform actions within the context of the current user. The vulnerability was classified as Inclusion of functionality from untrusted control sphere vulnerability in the CVE list. Remediation: Scripts should not be included from untrusted domains. Applications that consider the use of third-party scripts should copy the contents of the scripts to their own domain else re-implement the scripts functionality within the application code. D. Password with autocomplete enabled There were two instances of this issue on the site. It occurred on the root page and the careers page. This function can be configured by the user and by applications that employ user credentials. This functionality allows the storage of user credentials on the local computer and is retrieved on future visits to the same application. The stored credentials can be captured by an attacker who gains control over the user's computer. The vulnerability was classified as Inclusion of functionality from untrusted control sphere vulnerability in the CVE list. Remediation: Include the attribute autocomplete=”off” within the FORM tag (to protect all form fields) or within the relevant INPUT tags (to protect specific individual fields). E. Browser cross-site scripting filter disabled Some browsers, including Internet Explorer, contain builtin filters designed to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Applications can instruct browsers to disable this filter by setting the following response header: X-XSS-Protection: 0. This behaviour does not in itself constitute a vulnerability; in some cases, XSS filters may themselves be leveraged to perform attacks against application users. However, in typical situations, XSS filters do provide basic protection for application users against some XSS vulnerabilities in applications. The presence of this header should be reviewed to establish whether it affects the application’s security posture. Remediation: Review whether the application needs to disable XSS filters. In most cases you can gain the protection provided by XSS filters without the associated risks by using the following response header: X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block F. Client-side HTTP parameter pollution (reflected) Client-side HTTP parameter pollution (HPP) vulnerabilities arise when an application embeds user input in URLs in an unsafe manner. An attacker can use this vulnerability to construct a URL that, if visited by another application user, will modify URLs within the response by inserting additional query string parameters and sometimes overriding existing ones. This may result in links and forms having unexpected side effects. For example, it may be possible to modify an invitation form using HPP so that the invitation is delivered to an unexpected recipient. Remediation: Ensure that user input is URL-encoded before it is embedded in a URL. G. Email addresses disclosed The presence of email addresses within application responses does not necessarily constitute a security vulnerability. Email addresses may appear intentionally within contact information, and many applications (such as web mail) include arbitrary third-party email addresses within their core content. Remediation: Consider removing any email addresses that are unnecessary. Provide a form that generates the email server-side, protected by a CAPTCHA if necessary. H. Cacheable HTTPS response Remediation: Applications should return caching directives instructing browsers not to store local copies of any sensitive data. Often, this can be achieved by configuring the web serve








5. Conclusion
Penetration testing is especially important for web applications as many web applications are mission critical systems. Web applications often store sensitive data, and may directly or indirectly generate revenue. A web application breach can cause direct financial damages, negatively impact the reputation of the business, may cause the organisation to violate its compliance obligations and cause significant reputation damage.Since web applications handle valuable data, these systems are increasingly targeted by attackers. Here are key takeaways from the ENISA Threat Landscape 2020 and PT Security Web Application Threats Report: Web application attacks increased by 52% year-over-year in 2019. The average web application has 22 security vulnerabilities. One out of five vulnerabilities discovered on web applications is of high severity. 20% of the organisations reported that their applications services were hit daily by distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks. The most common attack techniques are buffer overflow (24%), resource reduction (23%), HTTP flood (23%), Low Slow (21%), and HTTPS flood (21%). Security misconfigurations are the cause of 84% of all observed vulnerabilities in web applications. 53% of web applications suffer from cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, and 45% have broken authentication. 39% of sites are vulnerable to unauthorised access, and 16% of web applications provide full system access to attackers.
For particular application of the tool we use different module shown as following table-
